										What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the
										printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
										industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
										unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
										make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
										centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
										remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
										1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
										Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
										software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
										Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that
										a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
										page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem
										Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
										letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
										making it look like readable English. Many desktop
										publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
										as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'
										will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
										versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
										sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
